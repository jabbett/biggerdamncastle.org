                <h2>Historical significance of Usen Castle</h2>
                <h3>Massachusetts Historical Commission, 1977</h3>

                <p>"The Usen Castle is a most unusual and historically significant building. It was built by
                    Dr. John Hall Smith, founder of Middlesex Medical School, in 1928. In 1945 the school had
                    been forced out of existence by the simple fact that few of its graduates were granted
                    licenses to practice. Facing the immediate prospect of closing, school officials decided
                    to pass its property and charter on to a group who in 1948 founded Brandeis University. The
                    structure is one of two buildings on the Brandeis campus surviving from the former college.
                    Employing local labor, and using second-hand windows and mechanical fixtures, bits of mosaic
                    and painted decoration, Dr. Smith constructed a building inspired by a sketch of Ireland's
                    Cavendish Castle. The fieldstone that was used for the walls had divided the site of the
                    campus into narrow strips where local farmers grazed their cattle in colonial times. Dr.
                    Smith built his Castle atop Boston Rock, one of the highest elevation points on the campus,
                    and the entire Boston area as well. It was from this point that Colonel William Bradford
                    first surveyed Boston in the mid-17th century."</p>

                <p>"In the early years of Brandeis University, the Castle housed administrative and dining
                    services as well as student dormitory space. In the 1950s, its 50,000 square feet were
                    remodeled into ninety single, double and larger living units to house 142 students.
                    Although the Castle had been deteriorating inside and out in recent years, it remained the
                    overwhelming choice of the 2,100 students who reside on campus each year. Probably chief
                    among the Castle's many attractions is its medieval air, an atmosphere enhanced by stone
                    archways, sharply defined battlements, turrets, conical towers and spiral staircases. On
                    this modern campus, it represents stone surrounded by glass, age by youth, tradition by
                    innovation and change. The Castle's recent restoration assures the preservation of a
                    symbolic historical structure and the building's continued use as a student residence for
                    many decades to come."</p>
